"about": "I am a motivated CSE student at Adamas University with a passion for building secure and interactive web experiences. My interest in technology began when I built my first HTML page, and I have since focused my academic and personal projects on Web Development and Cybersecurity. I possess a strong technical foundation in React.js, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript, supported by programming knowledge in Python, C/C++, and SQL. I am dedicated to crafting responsive user interfaces while keeping security best practices in mind. Beyond the screen, I am a creative thinker who enjoys photography, exploring new technologies, and playing the guitar.",
